\section{Introduction}
By using the event-driven approach for studying gene block evolution in bacteria, it allows us to determines the combinations of possible events to transition between the tree nodes. In this paper, I will provide a parsimony approach to reconstruct the ancestral gene blocks given the phylogenetic tree and leaf nodes

\section{Assumption}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Phylogenetic Tree:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Our phylogenetic tree is given, it is binary and rooted.
            \item Leaves are populated by orthoblocks. At least one leaf has a reference operon.
            \item The model is agnostic to gene order.
        \end{itemize}
    \item Relationship between parent nodes and their children:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Given a parent gene blocks, its children gene blocks can't have any gene that is not in the parent gene blocks. This is a quite unrealistic. I need this to buil the initial set. However, by providing some correction mechanism (reduction), I will remove this assumption
            \item There are 3 types of events that can happen from a parent to a child \footnote{An event-driven approach for studying gene block evolution in bacteria, Iddo Friedberg}:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Split : If two genes in one taxon are neighboring and their homologs in the other taxon are not, then that is defined as a single split event. The distance is the minimal number of split events identified between the compared genomes.
                \item Deletion : A gene exists in the operon in the one taxon, but its homolog cannot be found in an orthoblock in another taxon. Note that the definition of homolog, e-value \(10^{-10}\)  is strict, and may result in false negatives. The deletion distance is the number of deletion events identified between the compared target genomes.
                \item Duplication : A duplication event is defined as having gene j in a gene block in the source genome, and homologous genes (\(j{'}\),\(j{"}\))   in the homologous block in the target genome. The duplication distance is the number of duplication events counted between the source and target genomes. The duplication has to occur in a gene block to be tallied.
            \end{itemize}
            \item Multiple events from parent to children are possible.
            \item Events are treated as independent. (need more precise study)
        \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Event-Based Distance }
The distance between an internal node and its child is defined as below \footnotemark[\value{footnote}].
\begin{itemize}
    \item Split distance \(d_s\) is the absolute difference in the number of relevant gene blocks between the two taxa. Example: for the reference gene block with genes (abcdefg) Genome A has blocks ((abc),(defg)) and genome B has ((abc),(de),(fg)). Therefore, \(d_s\)(A,B) = $\bigl| 2 - 3 \bigr|$ = 1
    \item Duplication distance \(d_u\) is the pairwise count of duplications between two orthoblocks. Example: we have a reference gene block (abcde). Now, for genomes A and B the orthoblocks are A=((abd)) B=((abbcc)). Gene \(A_b\) is duplicated in genome B, thus a duplication distance \(d_u\)(A,B) of 1. Gene c generates a distance of one deletion (see below) and one duplication. This is because the most parsimonious explanation is that the most recent ancestor for A and B may have had one copy of c, thus generating a duplication in one lineage, and a deletion in another. Because gene d exists only in the reference genome, it has no bearing on the event-based distance between the homologous gene blocks A and B.
    \item Deletion distance \(d_d\) is the difference in number of orthologs that are in the homologous gene blocks of the genome of one organism, or the other, but not in both.

\end{itemize}

\section{Problem}
Given our model assumption and the event-based distance, the computation question is to reconstruct ancestral gene blocks with the fewest number of events distance to its closest children.
