\begin{document}
In order to build sets of ancestral gene/ genes blocks, I try to traverse the \
phylogenetic tree from leaf to the root by following methods:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Consider each non-leaf node at each level (bottom-up tree traversal).
\item All non-leaf nodes a given level are considered before moving on to the next higher level.
\end{enumerate}


I categorize internal into 3 different kind: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item The one that its 2 children are leaf nodes.
\item The one that has 1 of its children as a leaf nodes.
\item The one that none of its children is leaf node. 
\end{enumerate}


Because of this, to decide the initial set of genes/ blocks of genes, I provide 
3 functions with different parameters:
\begin{enumerate}
\item GenomevsGenome(Genome1,Genome2)
\item SetvsGenome(myTuple,Genome)
\item SetvsSet(myTuple1,myTuple2)
\end{enumerate}


Goal:
	The main point here is to determine whether I should include a gene in the 
higher level internal node. In order to do this, I need to have a count from 
each of its children, and build a transitional function. In this paper, I will 
present my transitional function, and reason why I choose it (hopefully 
with solid proof).


Assumption:
	Consider a gene g in our reference operon.
